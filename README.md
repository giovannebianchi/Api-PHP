# Countries List - PHP

## This is a study project

Hello, I've been studying again PHP because it's been a long time I not worked with PHP.

This is a project from [DIO's](https://github.com/digitalinnovationone) PHP full course.

Special thanks to [Stefan gabos](https://github.com/stefangabos/world_countries) to make available the JSON I used.

You don't need nothing special to run this project, just the Standard PHP.
